## Divercity Code Challenge

This project is a simple job listing app that allows the user to see job postings and apply to them. The user must be signed up and logged in to apply to the positions. The job postings were made available thanks to the API provided by the Divercity team's [API](https://documenter.getpostman.com/view/9521172/SzKVPxUg?version=latest)
